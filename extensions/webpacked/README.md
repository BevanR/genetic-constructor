Example plugin which uses webpack and displays in the sequenceDetail region.

Webpack is necessary for bundling larger projects, as only one file (`index.js`) is allowed to be served per extension.

## Installation

You will need to install `webpack` (https://webpack.github.io/) so you can run it from the command line.

`npm install`

`webpack main.js index.js`
