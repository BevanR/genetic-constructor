A Simple Genetic Construct Extension

This extension is only a single file, which will log events as they happen in the app.

It demonstrates what is minimally needed to write an extension, and demonstrates how to register it with the App.

This extension does not have any visual element - it simply exists and interacts with the app non-visually.

No building or installation is necessary.
