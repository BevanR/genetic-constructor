Extensions are client-side additions for Genetic Constructor, which allow for interaction with user's data from the client, and widgets inserted at specified regions within the app.

This directory is for local extensions only. They will not automatically be installed. Extensions that are accessible to the server should be listed in `/server/extensions/package.json` and will be installed using npm. Extensions in this folder will only be accessible if listed in that manifest.
